# SlingshotAI — Onboarding

Welcome to SlingshotAI. This repo contains your onboarding course, SAM (your Slingshot AI Mentor), and the vault folder structure.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this repo in your Obsidian vault:

1. Clone this repo into a `SlingshotAI/` folder inside the Obsidian vault
2. Create empty folders if not present: `Playbooks/`, `Outputs/`, `Notes/`
3. Copy `skill-packages/sam/` to `~/.claude/skills/sam/`
4. Clone the EP Knowledge Base from `https://github.com/aurioncompany/ep-knowledge` and install to `~/.claude/skills/ep-knowledge/` (copy SKILL.md, learn/, and references/ folders)
5. Remove the `skill-packages/` folder from the vault (already installed)
6. Remove this README.md from the vault (installation instructions only)
7. Set up the member profile at `~/.slingshot/profile.md` by asking:
   - Company name
   - Website URL(s) — support multiple sites (each with name, URL, what they sell, ecommerce platform)
   - Currency (e.g. GBP, USD, EUR)
   - Location (city, country)
   - Revenue stage (under $500k/yr or over $500k/yr)
   - AI experience level (never used / tried a few times / use regularly)
8. Save the profile using this frontmatter format:
   ```yaml
   ---
   company: [Company Name]
   sites:
     - name: [Brand Name]
       url: [https://...]
       sells: [What they sell]
       platform: [Shopify/WooCommerce/Craft Commerce/etc]
   currency: [GBP/USD/EUR]
   location: [City, Country]
   revenue_stage: [under_500k / over_500k]
   ai_experience: [never / tried_a_few_times / use_regularly]
   created: [today's date]
   ---
   ```
9. Confirm setup is complete and tell the member: "You're set up. Open Module 3 — How Skills Work — in Obsidian to continue the course."

## For Humans

If you're reading this on GitHub, this is the onboarding course for SlingshotAI members. To use it:

1. Install VS Code and Claude Code (Module 1 — on the SlingshotAI website)
2. Install Obsidian and create a vault (Module 2 — on the website)
3. Paste the setup prompt from Module 2 into Claude Code
4. Claude handles the rest — clones this repo, sets up your vault, and installs SAM
