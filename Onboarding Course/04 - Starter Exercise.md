# Module 4: Starter Exercise — Research & Build a Playbook

## What We're Doing

This is your first hands-on exercise with Claude Code. No skills to install, no dependencies, no setup. Just you and Claude doing something useful for your business.

You're going to pick a topic relevant to your ecommerce business, ask Claude to research it, and save the result as a **playbook** in your vault.

## Why Playbooks Matter

Before we start, I want to explain why we're building a playbook and not just "getting some research."

In Module 3, you saw that skills have a `references/` folder with playbooks inside. Those playbooks are the backbone of every skill — they contain the methodology, the scoring criteria, the decision frameworks that make a skill consistently good. Without the playbook, a skill is just generic instructions. With it, it's expertise.

Here's why that matters for you right now:

1. **Playbooks make Claude smarter about your business.** When a playbook sits in your vault, Claude can reference it in future conversations. "Check my email welcome sequence against the playbook I created" actually works.
2. **Playbooks are the first step to building your own skills.** If you ever want to create a custom skill (see the bonus module), the playbook is where you start. Research → playbook → skill.
3. **Playbooks compound.** A year from now, your Playbooks folder could contain twenty reference documents covering every aspect of your ecommerce operation. That's an unfair advantage — your own methodology library that Claude can draw from at any time.

So this exercise isn't just "get Claude to research something." It's the foundation of how the whole system works. The pattern is: **research → playbook → reference it later (or build a skill from it).**

## The Exercise

### Step 1: Pick a Topic

Choose something you've been meaning to research but haven't found time for. Some ideas:

- "Best practices for product page photography on mobile"
- "How to write product descriptions that convert"
- "Email welcome sequence best practices for ecommerce"
- "Returns policy benchmarks for [your industry]"
- "How to reduce cart abandonment on Shopify/WooCommerce"

Or pick your own. The only requirement: it should be useful for your business.

### Step 2: Ask Claude to Research It

In Claude Code, say something like:

```
Research [your topic] for ecommerce stores selling [your product type].
Create a practical playbook I can reference later — not theory, but
actionable steps I can use. Save it to my SlingshotAI/Playbooks folder.
```

Be specific about your business. "Product page photography for supplement brands" will give you better results than "product photography tips."

### Step 3: Review the Output

Claude will create a markdown file in your vault. Open it in Obsidian and read through it:

- Does it feel relevant to your business?
- Is there anything you'd change or want more detail on?
- Is it structured in a way you'd actually reference later?

### Step 4: Refine It

If something's off, tell Claude:

```
This is good but I need more detail on [specific section].
Also, can you add examples that are relevant to [your product type]?
```

Claude will update the file. This back-and-forth is how you get from "useful" to "exactly what I need."

## What Just Happened

You just:
1. Used Claude Code to research a business topic
2. Generated a practical playbook saved to your vault
3. Iterated on it to make it specific to your business
4. Created a reusable reference document

This is the foundation pattern. Every SlingshotAI skill is a more structured, tested version of this — a set of instructions that makes Claude consistently excellent at a specific task, with a methodology built from years of experience.

## Your First "Wow"

If you haven't had it yet, here it is: that playbook would have taken you 2-4 hours to research and write manually. Claude did the first draft in under a minute. Your job was to direct and refine — which is the highest-value use of your time.

This is what every SlingshotAI skill does, but better — because each skill has a proven methodology, a scoring rubric, and years of ecommerce experience baked into its instructions.
